## In need of an upgrade

Norfolk County Council had recently switched over to a new build of MasterGov and had expressed an interest in a newer register as they had received complaints from the general public about the UX of the current register, especially on mobile as the website didn’t adapt to the viewport of the device the user was on.

When I was tasked with improving the design I wanted to go one step further after analysing the old website. Some of the key questions I wanted to answer was:

- How much of the current register was a good UX? Features? Desktop viewport?
- Was there any pages in particular the general public were complaining about? Or was it the full process?
- Are there any areas of the website that are causing users to jump?
- What elements of the register are creating confusion/hesitation from some users.

## Time-constrained research

Norfolk County Council were about to go live with the new MasterGov updates in Q2 of 2021 and needed the register quickly. Many of my original questions couldn’t get answered without research and speaking to the general public.

To combat this constraint, I decided to reach out to Norfolk directly to ask about any complaints, reviews or times they’ve spoken to the general public. I spoke with Nick a senior planning officer from Norfolk and he directed me to the web team who knew about the complaints.

Many of the pain points users were hitting were mainly on mobile but the website also had severe accessibility issues that were preventing some members of the public from using the register at all.

> The old register

One of the biggest hurdles was that the current Norfolk Council website was a modern, accessible site people could access but the minute they accessed the register, some users felt like they were on a different website (this could cause security concern).

> The old register

I proposed to collaborate with the web team at Norfolk to run user testing on the dev environment while we review the prototypes internally. As this would allow us to deliver the project on time.

## Exploring ideas

One of my biggest gripes with the old register (and backed up by the research the web team did). When a user landed on the register, they were presented with all these fields that they did not know of. This created confusion and I pointed out that many members of the public tend to think in terms of their address or the application number if they have it on hand.

So I got to work exploring concepts/task flows to understand the process of the new register I’d design.

Aside from cleaning up the UI one of my major ideas I proposed was instead of many fields on the search page to replace them with a single search bar that would be capable of searching for addresses and application numbers.

## A simpler search

By having one search bar on the screen users would feel confident knowing they won’t have to fret about putting the wrong information in the wrong field. By empowering the field with the ability to search for not just address but application number, I hypothesised that this would still give choice to the user whichever way they wanted to search.

But I didn’t want to neglect the members of the public who do use advanced search, e.g. ward officers. The idea of advanced search was inspired by a developer on a separate team at DEF who had built it for another council. Advanced search allowed users who were knowledgeable about planning applications to do a more complex, filtered search.

We also hypothesised by having one search we’d improve accessibility by allowing the user to skip straight to the search bar.

## The result

Upon the developers building my prototype and running a test environment with members of the council and members of the public. The designs were a big success we saw a number of users who expressed delight in finding their application within a couple of taps on their mobile device and a few ward officers who were glad we didn’t remove the advanced search capabilities.
