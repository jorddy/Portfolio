# Jakeâ€™s portfolio site

All projects I have ever created.
The main branch is locked by default. You must create a Pull Request to contribute.

## Get started

Use git to clone the repository to your machine.

```bash
git clone [git-repo-url]
```

Install Docker and Docker compose on your machine.

Then run the docker compose command.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This website is created in Node.js.

This command will allow you to run the Node.js environment in a Docker container, with automatic reload.

If you add new packages from npm, you will have to close the container and run `docker compose up --build` again.
