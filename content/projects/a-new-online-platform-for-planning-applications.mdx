title: A new online platform for planning applications
summary: Dorset Council had commissioned DEF to undertake transforming their entire planning online infrastructure. As part of this I was tasked with collaborating with Dorset’s UX team to re-imagine the online portal for different audiences - including members of the public, ward officers and consultees.

## An overhaul to planning online

Dorset Council were going through a period of digital transformation in planning and as part of this had received funding from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities \*\*\*\*to help improve their services to the general public, consultees and ward/parish officers.

Dorset commissioned DEF Software to help transform their planning register into an online platform offering services such as tracking applications, subscribing to applications and RBAC-based login to offer better services to internal/external consultations.

I was brought into the project to help collaborate with Dorset on the designs for the online platform.

## Finding the weak spots

When I first got brought into the project I collaborated with Dorset to analyse the research they had done so far and do some of my own. I found that DHLUC had invested the money mainly into a new service to allow members of the public to set up their own alerting rules to keep track of applications in a way that best fits them.

Originally, this was what I was first tasked with but I also wanted to take on board what I learnt from re-designing the Norfolk register and bring my findings over to this new platform. I also saw an opportunity to create a modern website that would serve as a good basis for all the future registers we create; I took this idea to my manager and he agreed it’d be a great time/cost saving if we get this right.

## The first major task

One of the major goals of the project was getting the alerting service to work well. Based on the pain points and user research Dorset had done, I was able to put together a rough prototype of my ideas which we reviewed and continued to iterate.

> One of the earliest prototypes

We wanted a simple dashboard for logged in users to view alerts and turn them off with ease, but the simple dashboard served a twofold: making alerts easier to view and allowed easy expansion for new areas of the platform that members of the public wouldn’t have access to e.g. consultation area. RBAC would control this, however, I wanted room in the prototype if we decided to add more features.

We trailed out different ways of creating alerts: through a 2 step wizard and with maps. Ideally, we wanted different ways users could create these alert rules. For example, a ward officer may track applications in an area where as a member of the public may just want to receive updates on the extension their neighbour is getting.

We continued to iterate the prototype based on feedback from the team until we reached a higher fidelity state to user test with officers and the general public alike. The higher fidelity started to come together in the dashboard area where the user could configure and see all their alert rules

## Meanwhile in other areas…

Alongside the alerts I started pushing the other areas of the platform when I had time. Taking inspiration from other councils planning websites I implemented some new ideas for viewing an application’s lifecycle. This new design showed the lifecycle of the application from received all the way to decision but it broke down the steps in a timeline with a colour to indicate the status.

I also started to push the designs for mobile on the side to make sure what we were designing on desktop could work on a smaller device.

## The result

So far officers at Dorset have expressed delight and interest in the project and some of the iterated designs have been a major hit in terms of simplifying usability, accessibility and more options for different audiences to track planning applications.

In the future, Dorset hopes to get different users across the target audiences we’re aiming at for user testing of these prototypes.

**This project is still ongoing…**
